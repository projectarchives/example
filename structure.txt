Before you read this "tutorial", please make sure that you have a client and a server plugin ready. 
Visit https://github.com/redpois0n/jRAT-Example-Plugin for an example plugin.

Also, remember that both of the .jars needs a plugin.txt file inside containing the path of the main class.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Let's say we have our plugins named like this:

Something client plugin.jar
Something server plugin.jar

These needs to be renamed to:

Client.jar
Stub.jar

Then put them in a .zip so it will look like this:

archive.zip ---> Client.jar
				 Stub.jar
				 

And if you want you can add an icon to be shown in the jRAT client / plugin gallery

archive.zip ---> Client.jar
				 Stub.jar
				 icon.png // it must be named icon.png

When you contact redpois0n for releasing the plugin, you will need to provide some necessary information in a filesuch as:

#Start File
A plugin name 				<-- *The name that will show up in the plugin gallery. So put the plugin name here*
1.0 						<-- *Version of the plugin*
3.4 						<-- *Built for what jRAT version*
Will do this and that 		<-- *Description about the plugin*
CoolAuthor			 		<-- *Author*
#End File
